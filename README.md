#### Description:
This is the final project i made for CS50 introduction to computer science course by Harvard University. I liked this a lot, and i'm very thankful to David Malan and all other instructors for having made such a great course for free for whoever wanted to learn more about CS!


### About the project
The blog is just a first page with links to dinamic link routes, with some API calls with NOTION, that is where i store my pages!
