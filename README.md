#### Description:
This is the final project i made for CS50 introduction to computer science course by Harvard University. I liked this a lot, and i'm very thankful to David Malan and all other instructors for having made such a great course for free for whoever wanted to learn more about CS!


### About the project
The blog is just a first page with links to dinamic link routes, with some API calls with NOTION, that is where i store my pages!
When the user first gots into the page, he sees some intro stuff i made for my non-tech friend to know how to use the Notion stuff and learn how to make the pages.

Then i dinamically fecth through api calls all the pages that are present within that notion Database.
These are showed as cards and contain a dinamica link to the blog page.

Then this blog page renders the stuff that he has gotten through the API call.

This is the core of how a blog works! And it's soo cool to learn this now!

Sadly i didn't spent too much time trying to make the site beautiful to look. I justify it telling myself i don't want to work as a web designer or designer in general. I'd like to focus on the code part, and i hope i got that thing right. but i'm a beginner with no mentors, so probably i got many things wrong without knowing it. Anyway i hope i did a good job with this and i'm looking forward to take CS50 ai now. Thank you for this course!
